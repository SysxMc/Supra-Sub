            <p>EDIT: Because a couple people have asked, yes, getting in touch with me to offer input one-on-one is welcome, don't hesitate.


I'm 29f and the oldest daughter (and oldest sibling) in my family. As I'm sure plenty of other girls understand, being the oldest daughter isn't easy...there's even a syndrome named after it.

I've always been the mortar that keeps our family from breaking apart, the daughter and sister who people turn to in times of trouble. I always try really hard to rise to the occasion and be there for my family.

It's something my mom and dad generally recognize and appreciate; they see me as the "sibling in chief" if that makes sense, and have a level of respect for me that goes beyond that which they have for my siblings (though they love all of us equally). It's a role I take genuine pride it, but it can be exhausting to say the least.

For the past few months I've been living back at home to give my mom and dad some moral support while they deal with a really tough situation with an illness that a member of our extended family is going through.

My relationship with my mom and dad is good and strong but definitely complicated at times. I often feel like I'm not living up to my dad's expectations, as loving and supportive as he is. And my mom and I have an incredibly tight bond, but we REALLY know how to get on each other's nerves, and our fights are absolutely epic.

All this brings me to why I'm posting. And fair warning, this is where things get squicky and REALLY, really complicated.

My mom and I were having a heart-to-heart recently, and she opened up about how with me living back at home, she and my dad would like us to be..."closer." Not just emotionally closer, but physically closer to.

My parents want us to start going to bed together as mom and dad and daughter.

The reality of this is hitting me like a ton of bricks, and my mind feels completely upside down. I never, ever, ever thought that this is the sort of situation I'd find myself in with my mom and dad. As naive as it sounds, I thought this was the sort of thing that happened to "other" girls, other people.

If you only have something cruel to say, or your only piece of guidance is to "run away," please just close my post and move along. It isn't helpful.

I'm trying REALLY hard to approach this with empathy, as challenging as it is. Wrestling with whether to say no to them or potentially yes to them is the hardest thing I've ever faced. To those of you who have something kind or constructive to say, thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Probably not a major thing to many people, but I, a woman in my mid 20s, really wish I could just… be someone’s wife for the sake of image or something. 

Before I go further- I’m not going to string a man along and get into a relationship where he loves me and I don’t love him. I have zero desire to use someone like that. 

I have issues with my feelings; I’m often detached or muted, and it’s the sort of thing where I don’t feel love the way people expect. I still care, I still want people around me to be happy and well taken care of. but that’s often a feeling of obligation. I know that’s how a good person feels towards those around them, that idea. 

Lately I wish I could get pregnant, baby fever is hitting hard. But I don’t want to have a kid on my own, and I want to make sure they have a good life, one of which I can’t provide by myself anyways due to some health issues. I want them to have a good family foundation. While I find it hard to love another adult, I have always loved kids and have always wanted my own- but I figure that’s never going to happen unless I want to be cruel to either a man or a kid. 

So I daydream sometimes of having a man who gets it, that I don’t love him like that but I care about him. Maybe he feels the same way and is just meeting some quota for an image, and he knows he can do what he wants with others. I provide a good image, happy home and some kids. We get along well but we don’t love each other and don’t have expectations beyond basic respect and consideration when the doors are closed. I’ll make sure things are clean, we spend time as a family for the kids’ sake, he can go and fuck around and I can just take any free time to enjoy my hobbies by myself or something. A man who shares my ideas of wanting to be a father and having a good family foundation without having to be a loving husband. 

But that’s silly and unrealistic, and I know that. Like I said, I’m not cruel enough to lie about it. I just really needed to get the thought out of my head. 

Reiterating one last time, I have no real intentions of getting knocked up (would be cruel to bring a kid here when I can’t give them a good life) nor any intention of using a man. The dream is me and him agree wholeheartedly on this idea. </p>

            <p>Imagine going through a lifetime while looking like that, disliked by pretty much everyone and denied pleasure, and then you just die and it's just endless void. You will never come back or feel or see anything anymore. Just a shower thought, albeit a dark one...</p>

            <p>I have been a handyman for more than twenty years, and just had my first porn movie encounter with a client. I was there to do some small repairs and when I went to let her know I was done, she was smoking a joint watching gangbang porn in a robe and said I wasn’t allowed to touch, but, if I wanted to join her smoking and watching porn, I was was welcome to have a seat. We got blazed and spent the afternoon watching porn and casually masturbating. She kicked me out to air the place out before her husband came home. It was one of hottest weirdest experiences I’ve had. </p>

            <p>The title basically. For reference... I'm a shy, 23 year old female without a power kink lol. But fuck, I'd be lying if I said I didn't blush a little whenever someone, specifically men around my age, call me "ma'am."

For example, I'm a server and whenever I check in with my tables and I get hit with the "Yes, ma'am" and "thank you ma'am" I smile a lot more. And don't get me started on whenever my boyfriend does it. Idk why it's a massive turn on for me, but it absolutely is.</p>

            <p>We were kissing. It was going well. Then my brain short-circuited.

One year of drought hit me like a truck and I went full *National Geographic*. I bit her lip (not gently), I threw myself on top of her like I’d been released from a basement, I even made this weird groaning sound that I swear wasn’t human.

I don’t even know what position we were in. It felt like interpretive dance meets emotional breakdown.

At one point I was just kissing her neck and whispering “I missed this” like I was in a bad indie movie.

She was sweet, said she had a good time… but I know I came off like an unhinged golden retriever.

Now I’m sitting here overthinking everything, convinced she’s texting her friends “bro he bit me like a sandwich.”

Is this just post-intimacy shame? Or did I actually terrify a woman?</p>

            <p>I’m not proud of this, but I was broke. Funeral homes had food. No one questions a quiet guy in black. So I started attending random services.

Most of the time I’d just nod, maybe shake a hand, grab some sandwiches, and leave. But once, someone mistook me for “cousin Ray.” I panicked and said, “yeah, I’m Ray.” One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was standing at the podium.

I gave a completely improvised speech about a man I never met. I cried. THEY cried. I hugged the widow.

They sent me home with Tupperware.</p>

            <p>We, me and my husband and our kids, are at centre parcs for the weekend with two other couples and their kids. It’s been a great weekend we’ve been swimming, bike riding, out on boats, crazy golf, sky walking. It’s been lovely and the weather has been superb and the kids have loved every minute. 

During the day we tend to host at our lodge as it’s closer to the centre where everything is than the other two lodges. The lodges are L shaped and our bedroom is at the tip of the L with the outdoor seating area and bbq set inside the L. Yesterday me and one of the couples, Chris and Charlotte, did the skywalk and then the plan was to have a picnic afterwards. All the food was left at our lodge and after the skywalk me, Chris and Charlotte went back to the lodge to get the food while the others all finished off crazy golf. 

When we got back to my lodge I told them I was just going to get changed. I went to my bedroom and took off my vest top but still had on my sports bra and leggings while I was picking what clothes to wear. As I was taking off my leggings I looked out my window at the seating area and Chris was there having a cigarette and he was feeding a squirrel. I didn’t realise he was there and was about to close my curtains when it was like he read my mind as his head suddenly turned and he made eye contact with me while i was bending over with one leg out my leggings and knickers and pulling the other leg down. So far he hasn’t seen anything as our eyes locked together. 

I don’t know why I did what I did next. I just carried on. I took my leggings off, then my sports bra so I was now naked. I then pulled on my knickers, then my bottoms and stood there topless looking in my wardrobe like I was deciding what to wear for ten seconds when I already knew. I didn’t look directly but I could still see him outside out the corner of my eye. I then put my hair in a pony tail, put my bra on and then put a top on and turned to the window and made eye contact with him again. We both kind of smiled and then I walked out the bedroom. He came back in from having a cigarette and then the three of us carried the food and drink up like nothing had happened. 

Nothing has been said since by any of us and me and Chris haven’t acted any differently.</p>

            <p>This is going to be weird. And I've never told anyone but I really need to get this out of my chest. No pun intended and you will see why. 
I'm a 22 year old Filipina single mom and just gave birth to a beautiful litte girl a little over a month ago. So I'm back at work and my co-workers invited me over for a welcome back party to congratulate me. Well I told them that I could only have 1 drink because I am strictly breastfeeding my baby. My breasts were engorged from being full of milk so I needed to get back asap to feed. We were 4 girls and 6 guys. The girls left around 9pm, I was gonna go with them but the fellas urged me to stay because the party was for me. So I stayed a little longer. We had fun, ate a lot of food and I had 1 drink. My alcohol tolerance is pretty strong but oddly enough, a few minutes after drinking I got really dizzy and passed out. As I was passed out, my chest was painful. I remembered that it felt like I was breastfeeding on both my breasts. I can feel it but I couldn't move. I tried to open my eyes and saw 2 of my coworkers sucking my nipples while the others were playing with themselves. I couldn't see who but I remembered that a light was right on my face as if someone was taking videos or a photo. Then my eyes closed again and I passed out. It felt like a few hours have passed but could still feel them sucking on my breasts and squeezing them. They were taking turns on breastfeeding on me. I was too weak to even open my eyes so I passed out again.
When I finally woke up, it was around 3am so 6hrs have passed. I honestly thought that I woke up from a dream. I saw 4 of them sleeping on the floor and the other 2 was both next to me with their arms around me. I was still dressed but I didn't have a bra so that's when I realized what just happened. My breasts were sticky, painful and red. I have dark nipples but you could see that they were red and swollen almost double in size. My nipples were so painful that just having my shirt touching my chest was unbearable. I could feel that my breasts were empty like I just finished pumping or feeding my baby. My arms, chest and pants were sticky from some white residue and it smelt like you know what. I sat there for awhile thinking And that's when it all sunk in on me. Did 6 guys just breastfeed on my tits?? I snuck out and ran home. Never told anyone. Went to work like always. Everyone pretended like nothing happened. Everything was back the way it was.</p>

            <p>My 9yo son is autistic. Mostly nonverbal. In his own world 90% of the time. I've accepted that he has very little opportunities or options in life. Probably have him go to a group home, in a couple of years. He's very docile, low maintenance and an easy kid to manage.

The one thing that makes me sad is that he doesn't get invited to birthday parties. I get it. Parents are probably worried that about his safety or having to make too many accommodations. I'm just surprised that he doesn't even get pity invites from the kids in his special ed class (he is in special ed half the day and regular ed the other half). We live next door to one of his classmates who was celebrating his 9th birthday with a bunch of kids from their class. I thought it was a bit fucked up not to invite my son for a piece of cake. I was surprised because I wouldn't think twice about inviting the special needs kid over that.

My son is completely oblivious to it and it hurts me more than him. At least he doesn't get bullied. I hate how parents are so two-faced about it. They praise you for raising an autistic child and all of its challenges and then exclude him from social events. </p>
